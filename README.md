## Release Notes
Release notes and upgrade instructions are available on the [developer portal] (http://dev.rubiconproject.com/docs/Mobile_SDK_for_iOS#release-notes)

## Requirements
*   An account on Rubicon Project
*   Placement set-up for Revv for Mobile SDK. Please contact your Rubicon Project Account Manager for the placement information.
*   XCode 7.0 or higher
*   Deployment target of iOS 7.0 or higher

_While the SDK is compliant with iOS6, support for iOS6 has been deprecated so we strongly suggest upgrading your deployment target to iOS7. If your application supports iOS versions lower than iOS6 please make sure you set RFMAdSDK as an optional framework and that you do an OS version check before invoking the SDK methods._

## Samples
We have built some sample apps to show how to integrate our SDK in some typical use cases. Check them out in our [github repository](https://github.com/rubicon-project/RFM-SDKSamples-iOS)
